!help       You already figured this out
!stocks     Lists all stocks and most recent value
!notify     Add an alert
            [stock] [above/below] [value] [note (optional)]
!list       List alerts
!remove     Remove notifications - "!help remove" for more info
!bug        Send a bug report, add text after to describe the problem.

Example: 
!notify TCB above 900 time to sell!
```
